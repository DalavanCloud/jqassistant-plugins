jqassistant-plugins
===================
This repository contains plugins for buschmais' jQAssistant.

How to install
==============
For now, that's not quite user friendly. It will get better if jQA is more stable and the latest version
is available at maven repositories.
* get and install jQAssistant
* clone this repository
* build the plugins using gradle wrapper: gradlew jar
* copy the jar(s) from .../build/libs into the classpath of your project
* execute jQAssistant tasks

Coming soon
===========
* PMD
